pullmate
========

A bookmarklet to quickly hop from a github diff to the line in textmate. Tested with textmate 2.


Installation (chrome):
----------------------

1. Grab the bookmarklet js file and tweak the part that says `/Users/nick/reponame/` to the appropriate path to your root repo folder. Be sure to keep the trailing slash.
2. Go to the bookmark manager and create a new page bookmark. Give it any title you like.
3. Paste the code snippet into the url field for the bookmark.

Usage
------

1. Go to [hopefully] any page on github that displays a diff.
2. Select the bookmarklet in the bookmark bar or menu.
3. Click any of the `Txmt` links in the leftmost column to jump to the file in textmate.
